# Parking Slot Management System
This project is a Parking Slot Management System developed as the final assignment for the Programming Languages course (CS0035). Utilizing Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET), the system offers a practical solution to manage parking spaces efficiently.

## Features
- User Authentication: Ensure secure interactions with the system through a register/login process.

- Slot Selection: Users can choose available parking slots, promoting a seamless and user-friendly experience.

- Time Tracking: Efficiently monitor the entry and exit times of vehicles for accurate time-based calculations.

- Occupancy Duration: Visualize the duration of parking occupancy, aiding users in effective time management.

- Receipt Generation: Generate detailed receipts summarizing key information for users upon parking completion.

## Purpose and Scope
The project aims to showcase proficiency in programming languages, particularly VB.NET, by addressing real-world challenges in parking space utilization. It demonstrates a commitment to designing efficient and practical applications.

## Technical Implementation
The project utilizes VB.NET to create an intuitive graphical user interface, with backend functionalities handling user authentication, slot selection, time tracking, and receipt generation.

## Learning Outcomes
This hands-on project reflects the application of programming language concepts learned throughout the course. It highlights the ability to design, implement, and integrate various functionalities into a coherent and user-friendly application.
